You should click on the AIAlbiePrompter project in your CascadeProjects/AAIdeas directory. The full path is:

c:\Users\User\CascadeProjects\AAIdeas\AIAlbiePrompter

This is where we've been working on:

The history controls
The AI migration wizard
The WordPress integration
When you return, just open that project and mention that you want to continue working on the AI-guided WordPress migration system. The memory I created will help me recall exactly where we left off and what we were planning to do next.
